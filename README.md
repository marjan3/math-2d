## Getting started 
The project is a multi-module maven project consisting of:

- [gui](gui/)
- [math](math/)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. 

### Prerequisites
This section will describe requirements needed to satisfy the installation or running of the project.

 - Java 17
 - Maven
 
### Nice to have
 - Intellij

### Build
 - `git clone https://github.com/Tanevski3/math-2d.git`
 - `cd ./math-2d`
 - `mvn clean install`
 
### Run
 - Right click and run `MainEntry.java`
 
### Test
 - Run `mvn test`

## Future changes

- label position of point 2d is too close to point 2D
- undo/Redo is a bit clunky
- can't drop a vector or point into the first quarter
- implement other math operations
- improve code, separation of concerns, single responsibility, reduce duplication, maybe event buss
- always expand Inspect accordions
- write unit tests
